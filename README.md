About
-----

This is an Ex Nihilo style pack in a world of darkness and caves. Build up the tech tree, explore mystic dimensions!

Development
-----------

Working on the configs:
- Checkout the repository somewhere
- Download the repository as a zip, this will be a valid Curse pack that you can import in, say, MultiMC
- Delete the config folder in the instance, create a junction to the config folder in the repository under `overrides/config`

This will let you edit the configs as you play, then commit and push them. Here's how to make a junction on Windows:

`mklink /j targetfolder originfolder`
